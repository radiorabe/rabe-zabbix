### Item: Cache bytes

![component: memory](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-memory-00c9bf)

Cache Bytes is the sum of the Memory\\System Cache Resident Bytes, Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes, Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes, and Memory\\Pool Paged Resident Bytes counters. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Memory\Cache Bytes"]

### Item: Free system page table entries

![component: memory](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-memory-00c9bf)

This indicates the number of page table entries not currently in use by the system. If the number is less than 5,000, there may be a memory leak or you running out of memory.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Memory\Free System Page Table Entries"]
```

### Item: Memory page faults per second

![component: memory](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-memory-00c9bf)

Page Faults/sec is the average number of pages faulted per second. It is measured in number of pages faulted per second because only one page is faulted in each fault operation, hence this is also equal to the number of page fault operations. This counter includes both hard faults (those that require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found elsewhere in physical memory.) Most processors can handle large numbers of soft faults without significant consequence. However, hard faults, which require disk access, can cause significant delays.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Memory\Page Faults/sec"]
```

### Item: Memory pages per second

![component: memory](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-memory-00c9bf)

This measures the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults.
If the value is greater than 1,000, as a result of excessive paging, there may be a memory leak.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Memory\Pages/sec"]
```

### Item: Memory pool non-paged

![component: memory](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-memory-00c9bf)

This measures the size, in bytes, of the non-paged pool. This is an area of system memory for objects that cannot be written to disk but instead must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.
There is a possible memory leak if the value is greater than 175MB (or 100MB with the /3GB switch). Consequently, Event ID 2019 is recorded in the system event log.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Memory\Pool Nonpaged Bytes"]
```

```

### Item: CPU DPC time

![component: cpu](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-cpu-00c9bf)

Processor DPC time is the time that a single processor spent receiving and servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs). DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts. `% DPC Time` is a component of `% Privileged Time` because DPCs are executed in privileged mode. If a high `% DPC Time` is sustained, there may be a processor bottleneck or an application or hardware related issue that can significantly diminish overall system performance.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Processor Information(_total)\% DPC Time"]
```

### Item: CPU interrupt time

![component: cpu](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-cpu-00c9bf)

The processor information `% Interrupt Time` counter indicates how much time the processor spends handling hardware interrupts during sample intervals. It reflects the activity of devices like the system clock, mouse, disk drivers, and network cards. A value above 20% suggests possible hardware issues.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Processor Information(_total)\% Interrupt Time"]
```

### Item: CPU privileged time

![component: cpu](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-cpu-00c9bf)

The processor information `% Privileged Time` counter shows the percent of time that the processor is spent executing in Kernel (or Privileged) mode. Privileged mode includes services interrupts inside Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), executing Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs), Device Driver calls and other kernel-mode functions of the Windows Operating System.

```console
perf_counter_en["\Processor Information(_total)\% Privileged Time"]
```

```

### Item: Context switches per second

![component: cpu](https://img.shields.io/badge/component-cpu-00c9bf)

Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.
Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service.
It is the sum of Thread\\Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches.
There are context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.

```console
perf_counter_en["\System\Context Switches/sec"]

##### Discovery Rule: Network interfaces discovery: Trigger Prototype: Windows: Interface {#IFNAME}({#IFALIAS}): Link down

![scope: availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/scope-availability-00c9bf)

This trigger expression works as follows:
1. It can be triggered if the operations status is down.
2. `{$IFCONTROL:"{#IFNAME}"}=1` - a user can redefine the context macro to "0", marking this interface as not important.
No new trigger will be fired if this interface is down.
3. `last(/TEMPLATE_NAME/METRIC,#1)<>last(/TEMPLATE_NAME/METRIC,#2)` - the trigger fires only if the operational status was up to (1) sometime before (so, does not fire for "eternal off" interfaces.)

WARNING: if closed manually - it will not fire again on the next poll, because of .diff.
