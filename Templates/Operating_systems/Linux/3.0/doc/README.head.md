Monitoring Linux systems.

Items, triggers and graphs for monitoring various basic Linux operating
system parameters. Including low-level discovery rules for file systems and
network interfaces.

The template uses macros (with [macro
contexts](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/config/macros/usermacros#macro_context)
where feasible) for trigger thresholds which can be easily adapted to your
specific needs.
