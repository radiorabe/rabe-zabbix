Monitoring of the AXIA - ALSA soundcard driver for Livewire (_Axia IP Audio
Driver for Linux_).

This template collection monitors the components of the AXIA - ALSA soundcard
driver for Livewire, namely the _Axia Livewire Routing Daemon_ (`axialwrd`),
the _Axia Advertising Daemon_ (`axiaadvd`) and the _Axia GPIO Bridge for
Livewire/Control Surface control_ (`axiagpr`). There's also a check to see if
the `snd-axi√†` kernel module is loaded.
